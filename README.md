This is a **Java-based console application**.

The system simulates a simple e-commerce experience, including product management, a shopping cart, shipping logic, and checkout functionality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

The goal is to design and implement an e-commerce system that satisfies the challenge requirements:

> âœ… Define products (name, price, quantity, expiry, shipping info)  
> âœ… Allow customers to add products to a cart  
> âœ… Handle expired or unavailable products  
> âœ… Implement checkout with subtotal, shipping, and total  
> âœ… Collect and ship applicable products  
> âœ… Follow clean code and OOP best practices

## ðŸ§© Features

### ðŸ“¦ Product Management
- Products have:
  - `name`, `price`, `quantity`
  - Optional expiry date
  - Optional shipping flag + weight
- Distinguishes between:
  - Expirable vs Non-expirable
  - Shippable vs Non-shippable

### ðŸ›’ Cart Operations
- Add products by name and quantity
- Checks:
  - Product exists
  - Product is not expired
  - Enough stock is available
- Maintains list of cart items

### âœ… Checkout Process
- Validates:
  - Cart not empty
  - No expired items
  - Sufficient balance
- Calculates:
  - Subtotal (item prices)
  - Shipping cost (shippable weight Ã— 12)
  - Total amount and updates balance

### ðŸšš Shipping Service
- Gathers all shippable items
- Uses a simple `ShippableItem` interface
- Prints:
  - Each shipped item with weight
  - Total package weight

## ðŸ§ª Example Run

```java
Cart cart = new Cart(productList);
cart.addToCart("Cheese", 2);
cart.addToCart("TV", 1);
cart.addToCart("Scratch Card", 1);

Customer customer = new Customer(10000.0, cart);
customer.checkout();


Here's how you can include the output in your `README.md` file under an **Example Output** section:
